> Track the budget for every category during the month. The application calculates estimated totals for category by the end of month based on current sum. If predicted value overcomes the budget then corresponding indicator is marked out by yellow color. The forecast depends on time interval elapsed from beginning of the month. So, if the sum for category grows not too fast the indicator returns to green, indicating that you are on the right way. If the sum for category exceeds the budget the mark becomes red to the end of the month.
